I forgot to upload Bonus folder in time. I saw that I missed it now so I a, uploading it now just for bookkeeping purposes.
So, I guess, you won't be grading that which is fine but full_credit was uploaded last night that was before due time. So, please look at the history
and do check the commit which says "without .o files". 



In case you were already gonna do this anyway, Thank you and sorry for trouble. I am new to this git thing!
